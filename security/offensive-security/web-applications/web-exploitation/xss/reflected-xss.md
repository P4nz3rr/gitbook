# Reflected XSS

## Basics

Reflected XSS is non-persistent, and our input gets processed back by the back-end, like an error message. If the input was malicious and executed, we get a Reflected XSS.

Imagine a simple login form that displays an error message when invalid credentials are entered. We start the vulnerable demo server and try submitting a random username, we receive:

```
Login failed for user: test
```

Since the username is echoed back inside the response, we try injecting the same XSS payload used earlier:&#x20;

```
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
```

Submitting this triggers a pop-up in the browser, confirming our payload executed. Checking the page source reveals the error block:

```html
<p>Login failed for user: <script>alert(document.domain)</script></p>
```

This shows our payload was inserted directly into the HTML.

> This is non-persistent. So to target a specific user would have to send the user a URL containing the payload/parameters (GET). For POST there are other techniques.

```url
http://SERVER_IP:PORT/login.php?username=alert(document.domain)&password=test
```
