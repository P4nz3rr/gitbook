# Stored XSS

## Basics

Stored XSS is persistent, and most critical. It happens when our malicious XSS payload gets stored in the back-end after injecting on the client-side and gets retrieved when visiting the page. May affect any user that visits the page (persistent). It is also difficult to remove as stored on back-end.

To know if the exploited payload was Stored XSS, we can refresh the page to see if it executes again. This is not unique to us, and will trigger to any user that visits the page **(confirm through** <mark style="color:red;">page-source</mark>**)**.

{% code title="Common payloads" %}
```javascript
<script>alert(window.origin)</script> # Displays a pop-up window
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script> # Displays the current session cookie
```
{% endcode %}
